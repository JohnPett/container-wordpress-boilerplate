# Container WordPress Boilerplate
A scaffold to combine simple use of [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and ES6 as a [WordPress](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/) theme. Clone repository to `themes` directory to start.

### Quick Install

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun start
```
### Purpose
Low config install with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as a dependency. Minimal structure to integrate with [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and a [WPEngine](https://wpengine.co.uk/) instance using [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/). Boilerplate designed to work in the [LocalWP](https://localwp.com/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) / [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) ecosystem. A loosely opinionated workflow and toolset for managing WordPress in a modern JavaScript runtime.
